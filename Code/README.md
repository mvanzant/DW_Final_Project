This folder contains the Jupyter Notebook file for the project.

The file currently contains all python code for each step of the problem.

In the future I plan to split the file into two, the first containing the web scrapping and combining/cleaning it into a new csv. The second .ipyn file would contain the analysis including visulization and machine learning processes.
